Tipos de Mock
 
 Fake: a class that implements an interface but contains fixed data and no logic. 
 Simply returns "good" or "bad" data depending on the implementation.
 
 Mock: a class that implements an interface and allows the ability to dynamically 
 set the values to return/exceptions to throw from particular methods and provides 
 the ability to check if particular methods have been called/not called.
 
 Stub: Like a mock class, except that it doesn't provide the ability to verify 
 that methods have been called/not called.
